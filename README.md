Part of my artstyle was inspired by a deserted island model I made. I really liked how vibrant and cartoony it looked, so I wanted to continue this look on my mobile game.
The game ended up having a low poly look because of the fish model that I used. This also fit with the low poly look of my island

### What audio and sound effects are used?

I added an ocean ambience track and a countdown ding sound effect. I found the ocean sound on freesound.org.
The countdown timer was something I made myself im Ableton Live 11.

I would have liked to add more sound effects but didn't have enough time

– If applicable, known bugs
