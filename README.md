## About
Fresh Catch is a fishing game made for android devices, this project was made for the Mobile App Development paper at Otago Polytechnic

### Link to the mobile game on Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
I had trouble logging into the shared google play account

### What is the mobile game’s concept and genre?
I wanted to make a casual game, there was inspiration from endless games such as fruit ninja. However I felt like endless gameplay wouldn't fit so I added a timer.
The core gameplay was heavily inspired by the fishing minigame from Wii Play. This uses motion controls for its gameplay, so I wondered if the game would work on mobile using touch controls.

### What is the mobile game’s core gameplay loop?
The player is given 60 seconds to catch as many fish as possible, with certain fishes being worth more.
So the gameplay loop is trying to achieve a high score. 

### How do the players interact with the mobile game and control the characters or objects?
There is a fishing rod on the bottom half of the screen, the player moves this fishing rod by dragging it around.
This will move the bobber around on the top half of the screen, which is what the fish are attracted to. 

### What art style is used?

Part of my artstyle was inspired by a deserted island model I made. I really liked how vibrant and cartoony it looked, so I wanted to continue this look on my mobile game.
The game ended up having a low poly look because of the fish model that I used. This also fit with the low poly look of my island

### What audio and sound effects are used?

I added an ocean ambience track and a countdown ding sound effect. I found the ocean sound on freesound.org.
The countdown timer was something I made myself im Ableton Live 11.

I would have liked to add more sound effects but didn't have enough time

– If applicable, known bugs
